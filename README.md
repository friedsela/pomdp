The file "pomdp.py" contains an implementation of the algorithm described in the paper "Monte-Carlo Planning in Large POMDPs" by Silver and Veness. I run the algorithm on the Cheese Maze described in the paper "Learning policies for partially observable environments: Scaling up" by Littman, Cassandra and
Kaelbling.

The file "pomdp_learn.py" contains an implementation of the algorithm described in the paper "Learning Partially Observable Markov Decision Model with EM Algorithm" by Tan and Ma.
